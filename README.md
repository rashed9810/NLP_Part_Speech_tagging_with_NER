4. **SpaCy for Text Processing:**
    - Illustrate the installation of SpaCy.
    - Showcase how to load pre-trained models for different languages.
    - Demonstrate essential SpaCy functionalities:
        - Tokenization: splitting text into individual units like words or sentences.
        - Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging: assigning grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb) to each token.
        - Named Entity Recognition (NER): identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) within text.
    - Include code examples and visualizations to demonstrate these concepts.

5. **Stemming and Lemmatization:**
    - Explain the purpose of stemming and lemmatization for normalizing text and reducing inflections.
    - Provide examples of both techniques and their applications.
    - Consider including code demonstrations for stemming and lemmatization using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

6. **Vocabulary Matching with SpaCy:**
    - Discuss how to leverage SpaCy's vocabulary matching capabilities for tasks like entity extraction and similarity calculations.
    - Offer code examples and applications.

7. **Text Classification with Scikit-Learn:**
    - Introduce Scikit-Learn as a popular machine learning library.
    - Briefly explain supervised learning and text classification.
    - Provide an example of building a simple text classifier using Scikit-Learn (e.g., classifying sentiment or topic).
    - Include code snippets and visualizations of the classification process.

8. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Topic Modeling:**
    - Define topic modeling and its application in extracting latent topics from large text collections.
    - Briefly introduce LDA and its underlying principles.
    - Provide a code example using libraries like `gensim` to perform LDA on a text corpus, identifying topics and their corresponding words.

9. **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):**
    - Explain how NMF functions as an alternative to LDA for topic modeling.
    - Highlight its advantages and disadvantages compared to LDA.
    - Consider including a code example using `sklearn.decomposition.NMF` for dimensionality reduction using NMF.

    - Introduce Word2Vec, a word embedding technique that represents words as vectors in a low-dimensional space based on their semantic relationships.
    - Briefly explain the training process and applications of Word2Vec.
    - Provide insights into how Word2Vec captures semantic similarities between words.

11. **Sentiment Analysis with NLTK:**
    - Define sentiment analysis and its use in understanding the emotional tone of text.
    - Showcase how to use NLTK for sentiment analysis, including approaches like lexicon-based methods and machine learning approaches.
    - Provide code examples and visualizations to display sentiment analysis results.
